 Vote pod deletion:
 No impact. Replica set replaces the deleted pod with the new one.

Worker pod deletion:
No impact. Replica set replaces deleted pod. No loss of data. Logs are lost for the deleted worker pod.

DB pod deletion: 
DB pod was immediately replaced by replica set. Voting page had no impact, but the Result page is broken with no votes reflected. 
Can see that worker pod restarted post db deletion/reactivation.
Since old db was deleted, all the previous data is lost with it.
See from worker and Db logs that new data (votes) are reflected and worker pushes it to DB.
Since flow seems to be ok till DB.
Flow between Result app and DB needs to be fixed.
Deletion of result pod fixes the issue.
